## Project Structure

This project uses **npm workspaces** to manage the monorepo structure:

```
Ecommerce/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/       # Express.js API server
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/      # React application
â””â”€â”€ package.json   # Root workspace configuration
```

## Installation

To get started with the **MERN Ecommerce** project, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Ecommerce
```

2. **Install all dependencies** (both backend and frontend) using npm workspaces:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> Note: `--legacy-peer-deps` is required due to React version compatibility with some dependencies.

3. **Set up your MongoDB database**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory
   - Add your MongoDB connection string and other environment variables

4. **Start the development servers**:

   **Option 1: Run backend and frontend separately (recommended for development)**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Start backend
   npm run dev:backend

   # Terminal 2 - Start frontend
   npm run start:frontend
   ```

   **Option 2: Run backend only**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
